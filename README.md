# Voice-for-Filipinos
Voice for Filipinos was created on one belief: that the collapse of justice in the Philippines is not a legal issue alone, it is a national emergency. When laws serve the powerful instead of the people, corruption becomes culture and poverty becomes inheritance. Built with purpose, share experiences, exposing injustice and demand accountability.
